# ESW Requirement Test Mapper

## How to generate reports Manually?

Steps to generate the Requirement-Test mapping:
1. Generate the Test-Story mapping:
    - Start the sbt shell by command `sbt -DgenerateStoryReport=true` and run `clean`.
    - Run the tests
    - Test-Story mapping will generated in file `./target/RTM/testStoryMapping.txt`
    
2. Generate the Story-Requirement mapping from JIRA:
    - Go to the *story-requirement mapping filter* in Jira - https://tmt-project.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=17406
    - Export a Google sheet by using the option shown in the image
        ![screenshot](./filter.png)
    - Remove the first row from the sheet which containing the headings of the columns.
    - Export the sheet into a CSV file (`File -> Download -> Comma-Separated values`).

3. Call the TestRequirementMapper from the sbt shell by executing command
    - `esw-test-reporter/run <Test-Story mapping file path> <Story-Requirement mapping csv file path> <output file path>`
    
4. Import the generated Requirement-Test mapping in Google sheet.
    - Go to Google sheet and import the file (`File -> Import`) and choose the file.
    - Select a `Separator type` as `Custom` and paste a PIPE `|` in the text box.
    - Import the data.
    
This will generate Requirement-Story-Test mapping in a Google sheet.

 2. Copy the data of CSV file into a file `./tools/RTM/storyRequirementMapping.csv` in ESW repo.
 3. Commit the changed file and push the commit to github. This will trigger the jenkins build and
