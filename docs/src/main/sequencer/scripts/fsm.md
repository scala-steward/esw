# FSM

Scripts have ability to define and run Finite State Machine(FSM). FSM can transition between defined states and can be made 
reactive to events and commands.

## Define FSM

### Create FSM

To create an instance of FSM, a helper method `Fsm` is provided as shown in example. This method takes following parameters:

1. `name` of FSM
2. `initial state` of the FSM
3. `block` having states of the FSM

Kotlin
:   @@snip [Fsm.kts](../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/Fsm.kts) { #create-fsm }  

### Define state

As mentioned above, the third parameter of `Fsm` method is a block which is the place to define all the states of FSM. A method named `state` needs
 to be called with parameters `name` of the state and the `block` of actions to be performed in that state.
In case of multiple states with same name, the last one will be considered.   

@@@ note
State names are **case-insensitive**.

### State transition

To transit between states, `become` method needs to be called with name of next `state`. This will change the state of the fsm to the given state 
and start executing next state. `InvalidStateException` will be thrown if provided state is not defined.

Kotlin
:   @@snip [Fsm.kts](../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/Fsm.kts) { #state-transition }

State transition should ideally be the **last call in state** or should be **done with proper control flow** so that become is **not called multiple times**.

### Complete FSM

`completeFsm` marks the completion of Fsm. Calling it will immediately **stop execution of the FSM** and next steps will be ignored, so it should be called at
the end of the state.

### Helper constructs 
1. `entry` : executes the given `block` only when state transition happens from a different state

    Kotlin
    :   @@snip [Fsm.kts](../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/Fsm.kts) { #entry }

2. `on` : executes the given `block` if given `condition` is **true**

    Kotlin
    :   @@snip [Fsm.kts](../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/Fsm.kts) { #on } 

3. `after` : executes the given `block` after the given `duration`

## Start FSM

After creating instance of FSM, it needs to be explicitly started by calling `start` on it. This will start executing the initial
 state of fsm which is provided while creating instance of it.

:   @@snip [Fsm.kts](../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/Fsm.kts) { #start-fsm }

## Wait for completion

As FSM has ability to be complete itself, `await` can be called to wait for its completion. Control flow will be stopped at the `await` statement
 till the FSM is marked complete.

:   @@snip [Fsm.kts](../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/Fsm.kts) { #await } 

## Reactive FSM

FSM can be made to react to changes in event and command parameters with help of `Event variables` and `Command flags`.
 
### Event variable

Event variables are the way to make fsm react to events. Event variable can be tied to only one parameter key in an event.
To make FSM react to event variable, we need to create a `EventVariable` for a specific parameter key of an event and bind the fsm to it.

Whenever any event is published on the key of given event, all the FSMs bound to that variable will be re-evaluated.
Event variables use EventService underneath, which makes it possible to share data between multiple sequencers. 

Event variables are of 2 types:

1. `SystemVar` - for System events
2. `ObserveVar` - for Observe events

FSM can be bind to multiple event vars and vise versa. Following examples shows how to create event variables, bind FSM to it
 and methods like `get` and `set`. `set` will publish the event with modified parameter.

:   @@snip [Fsm.kts](../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/Fsm.kts) { #event-var }

### CommandFlag

Command flag acts as bridge which can used to pass `Parameters` to FSM from outside. Setting the params in command flag will re-evaluate
the all the FSMs with provided params which are bound to that flag. It is possible to bind one FSM to multiple command flags and vise versa.
Command flag is limited to scope of a single script. It does not have any remote impact.

Example shows how to create `CommandFlag`, bind FSM to it and methods `get` and `set` which are provided to retrieve or set the value of
 params in command flag.

:   @@snip [Fsm.kts](../../../../../examples/src/main/kotlin/esw/ocs/scripts/examples/paradox/Fsm.kts) { #command-flag } 

## Example FSM

In the below example, `temparatureFsm` demonstrates how FSM can be defined and used in the scripts. The event variable is declared 
with event key `esw.temperature.temp` for param `temperature` and `temparatureFsm` is bind to it. The job of the `temparatureFsm` 
is to decide the `state` based on the `temperature` and publish it on event key `esw.temperatureFsm` with param key `state`. 

Logic of state change is: 
   
| condition |state |
| :---: | :---: |
|  temp == 30 |  FINISH |
|  temp > 40  |  ERROR  |
|  else       |  OK     |

Key things (which are marked with `// [[ * ]]`) in above example code are :
 
1. The top-level scope of the FSM which can used to declare variables in FSM's scope and statements which should be executed while starting the FSM.
    Statements written here will be executed only once when the FSM starts.
2. The scope of the state. Code written here will be executed on every refresh of the state, so this is not ideal place to declare variables.
3. State transition from `OK` state to `ERROR`
4. Marks the FSM complete. Re-evaluation or state transitions cannot happen after this is executed.

    Till this point, it's all about defining the blue-print of the FSM like states, state transitions and actions to perform in specific states, there is 
    no execution yet. Only the FSM top-level statements are evaluated written at `// [[ 1 ]]`.

5. Shows the binding of `temperatureVar` and `temperatureFsm`. After this point, FSM will re-evaluate whenever events are published on `temperatureVar`.
6. Starts evaluating the initial state of the FSM
7. Waits for completion of the FSM. In example, the script execution will be blocked till line `// [[ 4 ]]` is executed which will mark the FSM complete and script 
execution will continue after that.  

Example code also demos the use of the helper methods like `entry`, `on`.
